## Future Enhancements (Optional)
- Create a new tab called "yearly statistics". on this page you will be able to select year and then display some fun statistic about how much work I have done and on what projects I have been working on. Maybe you can also calculate how much money I have earned the company since I'm a consultant. We need to add the average hour rate that the company bill out in that case. Evalute what would be fun statistic and make your own suggestions and implementations aswell.
Here are some suggestions: 
- Core Stats (the essentials)
- Total Hours Worked – broken down by project and month, this could be shown visually with a bar chart statistic at the top.
- Billable vs. Non-Billable Hours – visualized as a donut chart.
- Revenue Generated – hours × average hourly rate, with % change from last year.
- Top 3 Projects by Revenue – with hours and percentage of your total workload.

🎯 Productivity Insights
- Busiest Month – and % of year’s total hours it accounted for.
- Least Busy Month – could be a gentle nudge for better workload balancing.
- Average Daily Hours Worked – fun to compare to “typical” 8-hour days.
- Longest Work Streak – most consecutive days with logged work.

🏆 Achievements & Fun
- Most Frequent Client/Project – your “VIP” of the year.
- Milestone Badges – e.g., “1000 hours billed”, “Most productive Monday ever”.
- Coffee Cup Equivalent ☕ – estimate caffeine consumed based on hours (purely for fun).
- 
- Project Heat Map – months vs. projects showing workload intensity.
